# Snek

This is a Python project which recreates the classic game of Pong.

It's part of a short series of projects ([Snek](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/02-snek), [Pong](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/03-pong) and [Turtle Crossing](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/04-turtle-crossing)) written with classes using the Turtle module in order to better understand how these work.

You can try it on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/pong?v=1) directly in your browser, without installing an IDE. Replit loads the view window more slowly than your IDE would load a local copy, and your keyboard input doesn't automatically work for the game. Be prepared to click with your mouse into the interactive window immediately and begin using your directional keys to move your paddle.

Instructions for creating a local copy are available in the main [README.md file](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/blob/main/README.md).
