This is a Python project which recreates the classic game of Pong.

You can try it on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/pong?v=1) directly in your browser, without installing an IDE. Replit loads the view window more slowly than your IDE would load a local copy, and your keyboard input doesn't automatically work for the game. Be prepared to click with your mouse into the interactive window immediately and begin using your directional keys to move your paddle.

Instructions for creating a local copy are available in the main [README.md file](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/blob/main/README.md).
