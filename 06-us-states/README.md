# US States Game

This is a Python Turtle game in which the player inputs the names of all 50 states to complete the map of the USA.

It uses classes to make the code easier to read and more self-contained, along with the pandas library to handle reading the `.csv` file which holds the data.

**If you become stuck and can't think of any more states, please type "exit".** A list of states you missed will then be written to `./resources/states_to_learn.csv` to help you revise for another attempt.

This is the final project of the earlier series of games ([Snek](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/02-snek), [Pong](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/03-pong) and [Turtle Crossing](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/04-turtle-crossing)) written with classes using the Turtle module.

You can try it on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/us-states?v=1) directly in your browser, without installing an IDE.

Instructions for creating a local copy are available in the main [README.md file](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/blob/main/README.md).
