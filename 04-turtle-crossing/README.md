"I say, I say, I say! Why did the Turtle cross the road?"

"It was programmed that way."

##

This is a Python project which attempts to recreate the Crossy Road game experience, without the fancy graphics the Turtle module just doesn't provide.

It's part of a short series of projects ([Snek](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/02-snek), [Pong](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/03-pong), [Turtle Crossing](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/04-turtle-crossing) and the [US States](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/06-us-states) game) written with classes using the Turtle module in order to better understand how these work.

There is no reverse, no left and no right. Keep moving forward by pressing the up arrow. Don't get hit by a car (alright, a square, then)! That's all there is to it. Good luck!

You can try it on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/pong?v=1) directly in your browser, without installing an IDE.

Instructions for creating a local copy are available in the main [README.md file](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/blob/main/README.md).
