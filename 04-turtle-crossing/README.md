"I say, I say, I say! Why did the Turtle cross the road?"

"It was programmed that way."

This is a Python project which attempts to recreate the Crossy Road game experience, without the fancy graphics the Turtle module just doesn't provide.

There is no reverse, no left and no right. Keep moving forward by pressing the up arrow. Don't get hit by a car! That's all there is to it. Good luck!
