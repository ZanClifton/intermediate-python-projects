This is a Python project which features a PostgreSQL database, hosted at [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/), used to manage inventory for a book store. There is the capacity to register as a reviewer and leave reviews for books you have read.

Try it on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/treat-your-shelf?v=1) directly in your browser, without installing an IDE.

Instructions for creating a local copy are available in the main [README.md file](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/blob/main/README.md).
