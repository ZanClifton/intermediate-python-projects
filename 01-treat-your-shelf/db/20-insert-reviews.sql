    (7, 'Hard going', 'No doubt this is a classic for a reason, but this was one of the hardest books to read. I couldn''t finish it; it was so bleak. Brilliantly written, but too close to the kuckle and made me very uncomfortable.', 3),
    (1, 'Aliens love this', 'Great book as a Martian I found this very humorous. Nano Nano üññüèª', 5),
    (11, 'Just wonderful (sigh)', 'Jane Austen wrote one of the most famous opening lines in English Literature. The dialogue and writing are like the delicate keys on a piano or Earl Grey being being poured into a china cup. Light delicious and fragrant. Lizzy is an intelligent, inspirational and engaging character, who doesn''t bow down to the social expectations of the time. This novel certainly deserves its place in the Top 10 of the BBC Big Read.', 5),
    (7, 'Bought for my son', 'Bought this for my son so can''t review it properly although he said it was brilliant', 5),
    (7, 'Fantastic read! Loved it.', 'One of the best books I have read in a while. I don''t usually like fiction, but this is something else. Fantastic read!', 5),
    (1, 'Hilarious and Entertaining', 'One of the best books I''ve ever read, both sci-fi and comedy. It''s just so witty, clever, and amazing at subverting expectations in all the best ways. It''s honestly hard to put down. While the plot is simple, that doesn''t hinder the story to deliver a shockingly well developed galaxy and alien races. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a laugh.', 5),
    (7, 'English', 'As an English literature student I required this book for my studies, it is a good copy of the book, easy to analyse', 4),
    (11, 'I hate romance', 'Had to read this for school. It was awful and I never want to read anything like it again', 1),
    (1, 'It''s decent but not the absolute best', null, 4),
    (3, 'Happy birthday Peter Rabbit', '120 years since the first publication of the Tale of Peter Rabbit. A must for Beatrix Potter fans, a beautiful collectors book. Especially lovely as a gift for a new baby born this year or a child''s birthday - or adult birthday if a fan like me - Who doesn''t love Peter Rabbit ? üêá', 5);
