# Pomodoro Timer

Using the Tkinter module this app creates a timer which utilises the [Pomodoro Method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/take-it-from-someone-who-hates-productivity-hacksthe-pomodoro-technique-actually-works) to help you be more productive.

For 3 iterations, a 25 minute session of work time is followed by a 5 minute break, and after the fourth round of work, a longer break of 30 minutes is provided. This technique is apparently very effective as the timer prevents distraction and increases focus during work periods, but the frequent and generous breaks help to avoid stress.

You can try it on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/pomodoro?v=1) directly in your browser, without installing an IDE.

Instructions for creating a local copy are available in the main [README.md file](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/blob/main/README.md).
