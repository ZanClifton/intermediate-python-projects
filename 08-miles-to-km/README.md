# Miles to Km Converter

This simple app uses the Tkinter module to convert a number given in miles to kilometres.

Enter any number of miles (with or without decimal places), and discover how far it is in kilometres to two decimal places.

You can try it on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/miles-to-km?v=1) directly in your browser, without installing an IDE.

Instructions for creating a local copy are available in the main [README.md file](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/blob/main/README.md).
