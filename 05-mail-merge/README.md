# Mail Merge

This is a Python project which creates a simple mail merge from some basic data, nested in folders, for practice managing input and output of text files along with simple navigation.

The input comes from two files:

- `./Input/Letters/starting_letter.txt`
- `./Input/Names/invited_names.txt`

The input is cleaned up and combined and output to:

- `./Output/ReadyToSend/` with the file named after the recipient of each letter

Instructions for creating a local copy are available in the main [README.md file](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/blob/main/README.md).
