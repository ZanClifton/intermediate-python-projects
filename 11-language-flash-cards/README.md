# Language Flash Cards

Using the Tkinter module this app helps you commit to memory the 100 most commonly used words in French. Once you have learned a word, it will be removed from your revision list.

Each flash card is shown for 3 seconds. If you correctly translate the word, select the check mark and you won't see that word again. If you need more practice with it, select the cross and the word will go back in rotation.

To utilise this app, you will need to install the Tkinter module. You can do this in the command line interface.

**For Tkinter:**

Ubuntu:

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

MacOS:

```
brew install python-tk
```

You can try it on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/language-flash-cards?v=1) directly in your browser, without installing an IDE.

Instructions for creating a local copy are available in the main [README.md file](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/blob/main/README.md).
