## Replit

All these projects are hosted on Replit where you can try them out online without needing to clone the repo or install an IDE. Generally, they increase in complexity, but their running order is chronological from when they were created.

1. Treat Your Shelf
2. Snake
3. Pong
4. Turtle Crossing

Terminal Commands:

### ✔️ 2. USAGE

You ideally need an IDE to run these projects locally. I recommend VS Code or PyCharm. However, they will run in the terminal as follows:

Navigate into the folder of the project you wish to run, for example:

```
$ cd 01-treat-your-shelf
```

Run the script in the terminal:

```
$ python3 main.py
```

#

### Python 3.8

These projects were created using Python 3.8. Please make sure you've updated Python to the latest available version.
