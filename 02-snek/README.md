# Snek

This is a Python project which recreates the classic 'Snake' game.

It's part of a short series of projects ([Snek](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/02-snek), [Pong](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/03-pong), [Turtle Crossing](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/04-turtle-crossing) and the [US States](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/tree/main/06-us-states) game) written with classes using the Turtle module in order to better understand how these work.

You can try it on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/snek?v=1) directly in your browser, without installing an IDE. Replit loads the view window more slowly than your IDE would load a local copy, and your keyboard input doesn't automatically work for the game. Be prepared to click with your mouse into the interactive window immediately and then hit the up or down directional arrows to prevent the game ending before you can play.

Instructions for creating a local copy are available in the main [README.md file](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/blob/main/README.md).
