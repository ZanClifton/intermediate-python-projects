# Nato Phonetic Alphabet Translator

Frequently forget what the phonetics are for the words you need to spell out on the phone? Me too!

Here's a little translator which will take any single word and return the phonetic code for you. It'll continue to do this until you exit the program by using the letter 'n' when prompted.

It does not accept special characters or spaces.

You will need to install the pandas module in order to use this app:

```
$ pip3 install pandas
```

You can try it on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/nato-alphabet-translator?v=1) directly in your browser, without installing an IDE.

Instructions for creating a local copy are available in the main [README.md file](https://github.com/ZanClifton/intermediate-python-projects/blob/main/README.md).
